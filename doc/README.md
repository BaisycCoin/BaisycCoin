baysic-Coin Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[baysic-Coin Core](https://github.com/baysic-Coin/bysc-Install) is the original baysic-Coin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of baysic-Coin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

The following are some helpful notes on how to run baysic-Coin on your native platform.
